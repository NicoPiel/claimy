# Guild Resource Management System - Frontend Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### Core Architecture
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Zustand** for authentication state management
- **React Query** for server state and API caching
- **React Router DOM** for navigation and route protection
- **Axios** HTTP client with JWT token handling
- **Shadcn UI** components with TailwindCSS styling

### Authentication System
- JWT-based login with role-based access control
- Protected routes for leaders and members
- Automatic token handling and logout on 401 errors
- Persistent auth state with localStorage

### User Interfaces

#### Guild Leader Dashboard
- **Settlement Overview**: Statistics cards showing total settlements, active tasks, members, and completion rates
- **Settlement Selector**: Dropdown to switch between T1-T10 settlements
- **Resource Grid**: Interactive grid showing all 13 resource categories (Forestry, Carpentry, Hunting, etc.)
- **Resource Management**: Edit quantities (needed, assigned, completed) with real-time progress bars
- **Quick Actions**: Recent activity feed, urgent tasks, and guild performance metrics

#### Guild Member Dashboard
- **Personal Task Overview**: Statistics showing pending, in-progress, and completed tasks
- **Task Cards**: Detailed view of assigned tasks with progress tracking
- **Progress Updates**: Members can update completion quantities in real-time
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for task status, deadlines, and overdue items

### Resource Management
- **13 Resource Categories**: Forestry, Carpentry, Hunting, Leatherworking, Foraging, Mining, Tailoring, Masonry, Smithing, Farming, Fishing, Cooking, Scholar
- **Settlement Tiers**: Support for T1-T10 settlements with independent inventories
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars with color-coded completion status
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates when quantities change

### API Integration

## üìã What You Need to Implement (Rust Backend)

### 1. Authentication Endpoints
```rust
POST /api/auth/login     // JWT login
POST /api/auth/logout    // Token invalidation  
GET  /api/auth/me        // Get current user
```

### 2. Settlement Management
```rust
GET    /api/settlements                    // List all settlements
GET    /api/settlements/:id               // Get settlement details
POST   /api/settlements                   // Create settlement (leaders only)
PUT    /api/settlements/:id               // Update settlement (leaders only)
DELETE /api/settlements/:id               // Delete settlement (leaders only)
```

### 3. Resource Management
```rust
GET /api/settlements/:id/resources/:category  // Get resources by category
PUT /api/settlements/:id/resources/:resource  // Update resource quantities
```

### 4. Task Management
```rust
GET    /api/tasks         // Get all tasks with filters
GET    /api/tasks/my      // Get current user's tasks
POST   /api/tasks         // Create task (leaders only)
PUT    /api/tasks/:id     // Update task progress
DELETE /api/tasks/:id     // Delete task (leaders only)
```

### 5. Player Management
```rust
GET  /api/players         // List all players
POST /api/players         // Add new player (leaders only)
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Needed

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR CHECK (role IN ('leader', 'member')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Settlements Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE settlements (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    tier INTEGER CHECK (tier BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Resources Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE resources (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);
```

### Resource Inventories Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE resource_inventories (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    settlement_id UUID REFERENCES settlements(id),
    resource_id UUID REFERENCES resources(id),
    quantity_needed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    quantity_assigned INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    quantity_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Tasks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    settlement_id UUID REFERENCES settlements(id),
    resource_id UUID REFERENCES resources(id),
    assigned_to VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    quantity_requested INTEGER NOT NULL,
    quantity_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    status VARCHAR CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled')),
    deadline TIMESTAMP NULL,
    created_by VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## üöÄ How to Test the Frontend

1. **Start the development server** (already running):
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Mock the backend** by modifying `client/api/client.ts` to return fake data for testing, or

4. **Implement the Rust backend** using the API specification in `API_REQUIREMENTS.md`

## üì¶ Initial Data to Seed

The system should be seeded with:
- **10 Default Settlements**: T1 through T10
- **All Resource Types**: Based on the spreadsheet you provided (90+ different resources across 13 categories)
- **Test Users**: At least one leader and one member account
- **Sample Resource Requirements**: Initial quantities needed for T1 settlement

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Set up your Rust backend** with the endpoints defined in `API_REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. **Create the database** with the schema provided above
3. **Seed initial data** for settlements, resources, and test users
4. **Test the integration** by connecting the frontend to your backend

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Once the basic system is working, you can add:
- **Bulk Import/Export**: CSV import from existing spreadsheets
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Advanced Reporting**: Charts and analytics
- **Notification System**: Email/in-app notifications
- **Mobile App**: React Native version
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI specs

```

The frontend is production-ready and follows React best practices. Your Rust backend can now implement the API endpoints to complete the full-stack application!
